Small service that connects a [pixelblaze](https://www.bhencke.com/pixelblaze) to MQTT.

Mainly written to work well with a [Home Assistant MQTT Light (default schema)](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/light.mqtt/#default-schema), but other MQTT-speaking things also work obviously.

It would be nicer to talk to the pixelblaze directly from [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/), but this was way easier to make :)
